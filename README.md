# About

This project made with WEBPACK.<br/>You may look for a webpack-config.js file in the root directory!<br/> At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph from one or more entry points and then combines every module your project needs into one or more bundles, which are static assets to serve your content from.<br/>
Also this repository contains a few tasks from JavaScript!
